7</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> placing this volume in the hands
of his congregation, as a memorial of the centenary of Kensington
Chapel, the writer has one or two words to say to them.&nbsp;
They will easily see that there is here no attempt to supersede
Dr. Stoughton&rsquo;s excellent and well-known history of our
Church, entitled &ldquo;Congregationalism in the Court
Suburb.&rdquo;&nbsp; For all detail of our work, as well as for
most delightful reminiscences of the ministers who laboured here,
they are referred to Dr. Stoughton&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; The
letterpress of this little book is an introduction to the
pictures it contains, and it is an attempt to trace the rise and
progress of the <i>Church</i>, rather than to dwell on the <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>interesting
features of individual ministries.&nbsp; This has, as the writer
feels, limited the interest of the book somewhat; but he relies
largely on the illustrations to commend it to those who have some
sympathy with the Church whose doings it briefly
chronicles.&nbsp; He has only to add that his best thanks are due
to Mr. Sidney Davie, who has given him valued assistance in the
reproduction of the photographs; and to Mr. Edward Spicer for
very much co-operation in bringing out this memorial
volume.&nbsp; But especially is he indebted to the &ldquo;member
of the congregation,&rdquo; whose name he may not mention, who so
kindly wrote the notice of the three and a half years of the
present ministry.</p>

<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span><span
class="smcap">There</span> is but little of the romance of
history associated with the story of the Nonconformity of the
last hundred years.&nbsp; The Free Churches that arose in England
a century ago began with all the advantages of toleration.&nbsp;
Their members were not objects of persecution, and the chapels
that formed their local habitations had no longer to be built in
obscure courts that testified to the unpopularity, and possibly
the irregularity, of their existence.&nbsp; Churches that have
such an inheritance as ours lose, no doubt, much of the stimulus
which those <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>enjoy that have great traditions of heroism and fidelity
through stern seasons of suffering for conscience&rsquo;
sake.&nbsp; In the absence of such stirring pages from our
history, we may well be thankful that so much remains which we
may regard with especial gratitude to God, in the consistently
true and honourable service rendered to the cause of Christ
through four generations by the ministers and members of our
Church.&nbsp; The story of Kensington Chapel for the hundred
years of its history has been that of a succession of able and
devoted ministers, supported by a Church of consecrated men and
women, who have not unworthily represented the best traditions of
the Nonconformity of the last century.&nbsp; Neither has the
atmosphere of the Court suburb injuriously affected the definite
and resolute Dissenting attitude of the community.&nbsp; <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>The first
document issued by the founders of the Church contained an
explicit avowal that they were &ldquo;Dissenters from the
established mode of worship in this country&rdquo;; and any
subsequent movement of thought has only been toward a clearer
apprehension of those great positive beliefs which form the
permanent <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of a Congregational
Church.&nbsp; Mr. Faulkner, whose history of old Kensington is
full of interesting information, is a good Church and State man,
and quite above suspicion as to the orthodoxy of his opinions;
but he bears testimony to the Independents that we are &ldquo;a
sect, the most respectable, and usually considered the most
enlightened among Protestant Dissenters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably
this was not committing himself to much in Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s
opinion: and possibly some may be found who think that our <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>special
temptation has lain in the direction of our respectability; but
we must accept, with all the graciousness of which we are
capable, this tribute to the fact that our founders honourably
sustained the traditions of our denomination.&nbsp; And what is
equally remarkable, they succeeded in informing even an outsider
like Mr. Faulkner of their primary contention&mdash;surely no
small achievement!&mdash;for he writes of us: &ldquo;They are
amenable as a religious society only to the jurisdiction of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other respects also he does no injustice
to the Independent position.</p>
<p>Of the Kensington of 1793 I need not say much; for most of
those who read this little book will be quite familiar with the
astonishing change that has come over this locality since
then.&nbsp; We like to recall the fields and woods through which
the first seat-holders of <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Hornton Street Chapel walked to
worship on the Sunday, even though the thought suggests
melancholy reflections on our own loss in this respect.&nbsp; We
are more content to have a century of time between ourselves and
the footpads who infested the road that led to London.&nbsp; It
appears that in 1820, when Mr. Faulkner was completing his
history, a new church had been erected in Marylebone; and we are
congratulated on the fact, because the joint parishes of
Kensington and Paddington contain as many as twelve thousand
people!&nbsp; And as for some years previous the great increase
in the population had been causing considerable anxiety, and even
alarm, we may easily estimate the paucity of the population of
Kensington in 1793.</p>
<p>The year of our origin is famous in history <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>as the French
Revolution year.&nbsp; We cannot forget to what gloomy
forebodings, as to the future of religion, that momentous event
gave rise.&nbsp; It is not of course anything heroic, but it is
not without its sublime side, that amid the wild and violent
prophesyings of that time, the founders of this Church sat
quietly down to discuss plans and estimates for erecting a
meeting-house for those to worship in who, as they believed,
would still desire to seek the Lord, when all the
&ldquo;fool-fury of the Seine&rdquo; was remembered only with
horror and pity.&nbsp; Theirs was a sound, substantial faith that
was not frightened by chimeras, nor even dismayed by actual
portents as alarming as the French Revolution.&nbsp; When a State
has thrown over its Church with such violence as was used in
France, it was surely something to belong to a Church that asked
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>nothing,
and expected nothing, from the State, except freedom to do its
work unpatronised and unmolested.</p>
<p>While March, 1793, is the date of the first public document
introducing the new church to the inhabitants of Kensington, it
is quite clear that a quiet and effective spiritual work had been
proceeding in a very simple way for some time previous to the
erection of Hornton Street Chapel.&nbsp; This work was largely
due to Mr. Saunders, the &ldquo;body coachman&rdquo; of George
III., who was in the habit of providing His Majesty with
religious tracts, and who had now retired to Kensington, where he
was apparently the guiding spirit of a small conventicle
&ldquo;in a very humble dwelling.&rdquo;&nbsp; In such apostolic
simplicity the Church began, and in course of time there was a
sufficient nucleus of members and sympathisers with the freer <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>methods of
worship of the Dissenters, as to justify the issuing of the
following most significant appeal, which stands as the beginning
of the Church records, but has no date attached:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the friends of Religious Liberty,
Sincere Christianity, and of Benevolent dispositions,
etc.,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We the Undersigned, of Whom, some have been educated in
the principles of the Established Church of Scotland, and Others
in that Class of dissenters in England, whose principles,
Opinions and Faith, is the most generally Consonant To, and
founded on the Word of God, as Revealed in the Scriptures of the
Old and New Testament, and of These Essential Doctrines of
Christianity as Professed by both the National Churches of
England <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>and Scotland;&mdash;Being therefore dissenters from the
Established Mode of Worship in this Country, and being situated
at a great distance from any place of Worship Agreable to the
dictates of our Consciences, We, from pure Motives of Religion
and Piety Alone, for conveniancy to Ourselves and Familys, and to
Others who may be like-minded with Us in Matters of Religion, Do
Propose, Under the favour and Blessing of divine Providence, to
Erect and Build a Temple for the Worship of Almighty God, in the
Parish of Kensington, and County of Middlesex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Profess Our Religious Opinions to be, According to
the Rites and forms of Worship, as well as of the Doctrines, and
Discipline Agreed Upon in the Confession of Faith, by the
Assembly of Divines at Westminster, (So far as the Circumstances
of our Situation will <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>admit of,) we wish to follow Their
Soundness of Faith, Purity and Simplicity of Worship, As far as
we judge them founded on the Word of God, and Agreable to the
Standard of Truth, Contained in the Holy Scriptures; The Alone
Unerring Guide of Faith and Manners;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We therefore invite the Serious Christian, The friends
and lovers of Gospel Truths, to join with us in this good
Undertaking, To promote the Glory of God, The interests of true
Religion, and The Eternal Happiness of Ourselves and fellow
Christians, Having nothing in View, but to forward the Attainment
of These Great Objects, We leave the Briers, and Thorny Fields of
disputation and false Philosophy, of factious politicks, and
Jarring interests of Ambitious Men, &lsquo;That we may lead quiet
and peacable lives in all Godliness and honesty,&rsquo; as
Commanded 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Closely
following this, apparently, was a somewhat similar appeal, dated
March, 1793, which shows, however, that the &ldquo;friends of
religious liberty, sincere Christianity, and of benevolent
dispositions&rdquo; had sufficiently responded to the first
appeal to justify very practical measures being taken.&nbsp; The
second document reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Kensington</span>.&nbsp; <i>March</i>. 1793.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Friends of Christianity and Religious
Liberty,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We the Undersigned having been educated in the
Religious principles of protestant Dissenters, Do from Motives of
Religion and Piety, for Conveniancy to Ourselves and families,
and to Others who may be like Minded with us in Matters of
Religion, being likewise Solicited by Many Serious, Welldisposed
Christians, <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>and depending on the blessing of divine Providence, With
the Mild Government of this Country, have resolved to erect a
Chapel for the Worship of Almighty God in the Parish of
Kensington,</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this purpose we have taken a Suitable Piece of
Ground on a long Lease, and Engaged to Erect, and Compleat a
Building, Estimated at Upwards of &pound;900, Which Work is
Already began and now carrying on, We are therefore induced to
Solicit the Aid and Assistance of all Liberal Minded, and
Benevolent Christians, to enable us to finish and Compleat So
Good an Undertaking, hoping that we shall thereby promote the
Glory of God, and the Interests of true Religion and Vertue,
Having Nothing in View but to forward the Attainment of these
great Objects,</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Voluntary Gifts and Contributions, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>from
Societies or Individuals, Which are hereby humbly solicited, will
be thankfully received, and gratefully acknowledged by,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">John

<span class="smcap">James Gray</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">William Forsyth</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Trustees</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Estimates even in those days were liable to be exceeded, so
that we are not surprised to find that &ldquo;upwards of
&pound;900&rdquo; meant, in plain figures, &pound;2000, for which
sum Robert Saunderson contracted with John Broadwood and the
other trustees to erect Hornton Street Chapel and
buildings.&nbsp; It is a matter worthy of note that one whose
name was destined to receive such world-wide renown, as the
founder of the great firm of Broadwood &amp; Sons, manufacturers
of pianos, <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>should have been one of the founders of this Christian
Church.&nbsp; He is described as &ldquo;a Harpsichord
Maker,&rdquo; and was evidently of great service to the society,
not only in the preliminary business arrangements, but
subsequently in introducing the first organ and developing the
musical service.&nbsp; But with the work of building well in
hand, we may regard the new Church as fairly launched, and
reserve our story of its opening history for the next
chapter.</p>

29</span>II&mdash;CONSOLIDATION: THE FIRST MINISTRY</h2>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span><span
class="smcap">It</span> is interesting to notice that the
positive principles uniting the first members of the society were
as yet very indefinite.&nbsp; They had clearly not formulated in
their own minds any very distinct doctrine of the Church.&nbsp;
They assembled together because they had a preference for the
freer form of service of Nonconformity, and wished to worship God
after the manner most consonant with their own feelings.&nbsp;
There were associated in the congregation Dissenters of many
varieties of thought, and, no doubt, of differing degrees <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of
Dissent.&nbsp; It was a matter of indifference to them what might
be the denominational preferences of their minister.&nbsp; The
first invitation was sent forth by the &ldquo;trustees and
subscribers,&rdquo; and was addressed to the Rev. John Lake,
M.A., of whose views as to Church Government we know nothing, but
have some reason to suppose he was a Presbyterian.&nbsp; This
lack of any positive basis of Church fellowship was a somewhat
serious obstacle to the spiritual progress of the community; and,
indeed, the early records of the Church are a most instructive
commentary on the necessity of trying to realise the Scriptural
conception.&nbsp; The purely business aspect of their undertaking
was for some years the most prominent one.&nbsp; The members of
the society did not meet on a purely spiritual basis: and very
imperfectly realised that the great <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>mission of the Church was not
accomplished by the provision of opportunities for their
particular form of worship.&nbsp; Hence we are not surprised that
some of the first ministers were often pained by the commercial
spirit that at times prevailed in the deliberations of those
responsible for carrying on the work.</p>
<p>With the same simplicity and modesty that had characterised
the initiation of the work, the chapel was apparently opened with
little or no ceremony, or blowing of trumpets.&nbsp; Not a
reference do the minutes contain to any inauguration
meeting.&nbsp; Notice was sent to &ldquo;the Right Reverend
Father in God, Beilby, by Divine Providence Lord Bishop of
London,&rdquo; informing him that the Chapel had been erected as
a place of worship for Dissenters, and requesting him to register
it in his registry, &ldquo;pursuant to the Act of
Toleration.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Comfortable in the possession of his
lordship&rsquo;s nominal consent, and august episcopal sanction,
the society proceeded to approach the Rev. John Neal Lake, M.A.,
at that time resident at Walthamstow, with a view to inducing him
to undertake the ministry at Kensington.&nbsp; Some sixty names
were attached to the invitation; and, in an admirably-worded
reply, Mr. Lake accepted the position in November, 1794.</p>
<p>With a pastor of their choice happily settled among them, the
time for entering into a closer and more spiritual bond had
clearly come.&nbsp; The tie of a subscription to the new building
was not a sufficient one for a community that was organised for
the purpose of extending the kingdom of God: and hence we are
fully prepared for the very simple and beautiful service held on
March 8th, 1795, <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>when &ldquo;a special meeting was held at the Chapel in
the afternoon of as many as were desirous of joining as members
and communicants at the Lord&rsquo;s Table, when Mr. Lake
attended and entered into religious conversation with those
present, to whom he also delivered a suitable
exhortation.&rdquo;&nbsp; To those who feel the supreme
importance of the Church, as distinguished from either the
outward building or the particular minister, this is a memorable
record.&nbsp; This building of the living stones into a Church of
Jesus Christ is far more significant than the erection of a
chapel.&nbsp; And this warm-hearted brotherhood of Christian men
and women has continued in the faith and service of Christ, in
unbroken succession, for a hundred years.&nbsp; The first
Communion service was evidently a very solemn and impressive
time.&nbsp; Even the minutes of the <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Church book lose the atmosphere of
formality.&nbsp; We learn how Mr. Lake descended from the pulpit
to the Communion table, where &ldquo;a linen cloth and
elements&rdquo; had been previously laid; <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a> how the &ldquo;great pew&rdquo; and the
adjoining pews were filled with communicants; how, after the
distribution of the elements, Mr. Lake returned to the pulpit and
delivered an exhortation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon the whole, it was a
good day to many present, and, it is to be hoped, a day to be
remembered,&rdquo; writes the Secretary, and proceeds to record
the names and addresses of <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>the &ldquo;occasional
communicants&rdquo; who were present.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Whether our good friend, the Secretary, exhausted himself with
this description, or became less industrious than formerly, we
cannot say.&nbsp; Possibly the unexciting but important work of
the infant community seemed to him to require not even the very
qualified notoriety of a minute-book.&nbsp; Certain it is that
until May, 1798, there is but little recorded; and then
&ldquo;another hand&rdquo; writes a short account of the monthly
prayer meeting of the London Missionary Society, which, we are
informed, was instituted &ldquo;for the purpose of sending
Christian missionaries to Otaheit&eacute;, Africa, and other
distant places.&rdquo;&nbsp; This prayer meeting was held
&ldquo;by rotation&rdquo; at Kensington, and marks the beginning
of the missionary interest of Kensington Chapel.&nbsp; <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Mr. Faulkner,
in his notice of us, says that an auxiliary missionary society
was connected with the chapel, &ldquo;which, by means of
contributions of one penny per week, raises the sum of nearly one
hundred pounds per annum.&rdquo;&nbsp; This excellent systematic
organisation of missionary interest, enlisting the rich and poor
alike in the work by means of a modest and regular subscription,
was a very satisfactory application of the business traditions of
the Church to the problem of increasing the offerings for
missionary enterprise.&nbsp; Possibly, after the lapse of nearly
a hundred years, there are some who might find it a helpful and
valuable thing to themselves and others to revive an old
tradition.</p>
<p>There is no account given in the minutes of Mr. Lake&rsquo;s
resignation, but our friend Mr. <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Faulkner assures us, with no doubt
some inward satisfaction to himself, that he at length quitted
&ldquo;the Dissenting interest for a curacy in the Established
Church, where he sustained a respectable and useful character to
the day of his death.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be idle to pay even
the tribute of a regret to this secession of ninety years
ago.&nbsp; And it must be clear to all that one with Episcopal
leanings was not the person needed to lead the people in the
complete consolidation of a Congregational Church.&nbsp; Mr.
Lake&rsquo;s resignation prepared the way for a sounder and
healthier development of Church life and government.</p>

43</span>III&mdash;A BRIEF MINISTRY&mdash;REV. JOHN CLAYTON</h2>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span><span
class="smcap">It</span> was in the month of May, 1801, that the
members of the congregation united in a very earnest call to Mr.
John Clayton to become their minister.&nbsp; As no fewer than a
hundred names appear as signatories, we may infer that
considerable progress had been made under Mr. Lake&rsquo;s
ministry.&nbsp; Mr. Clayton was still formally unordained, though
he had been assistant minister to the Rev. John Winter at Newbury
for one year since leaving college.&nbsp; He was barely
twenty-one years of age when he came to Kensington to take up the
work <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>of
the pastorate.&nbsp; The portrait of him that adorns the
Deacons&rsquo; Vestry, and which is here reproduced, was clearly
taken in the maturity of middle-life.&nbsp; He maintained
admirably the traditions of the Clayton family.&nbsp; His father,
the Rev. John Clayton, was a well-known divine, of the most
approved style of pulpit manners.&nbsp; We read with a kind of
awe of his &ldquo;thickly-powdered head&rdquo; and his general
magnificence of demeanour.&nbsp; Both his sons, George and John,
inherited their father&rsquo;s ideal.&nbsp; We have heard it said
that the Kensington congregation has never assembled punctually
on Sunday morning since John Clayton&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; It was
part of the service to watch the procession of their minister
from the vestry to the pulpit.&nbsp; Young as he was, he bore
himself so bravely, in full canonicals, with gloved hands and
dignified movements, that it is no <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>wonder the congregation conceived a
great admiration for his person.&nbsp; No one can look at his
portrait without perceiving that he was a man of commanding
presence; and we surely cannot wonder if he knew it, and utilised
it to the best advantage.&nbsp; And it is only just to him to
add, that the effect of his preaching was by no means due solely,
or mainly, to his striking appearance.&nbsp; He was a man of
great mental abilities, and had had considerable culture.&nbsp;
He was thus admirably adapted in many ways to the sphere he was
called to occupy.&nbsp; With a liking for the best society, and a
distinguished appearance, his courtly habits of speech and
carriage gained him a deference that was not commonly paid to
Dissenting preachers.&nbsp; If the assiduous cultivation of these
personal characteristics had tended to <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>make him less alive to the spiritual
necessities of his people, we should have been justified in
depreciating them.&nbsp; But it had not that effect.&nbsp; One
has only to read the energetic charge, which his father delivered
to him at the ordination service at Kensington, to see that the
fastidiousness of outward manner and apparel of the elder Clayton
were not incompatible with a directness, incisiveness, and even
vehemence of speech, that the warmest partisan might covet.&nbsp;
It seems probable that John Clayton took his father&rsquo;s
advice not to be an &ldquo;unfaithful, accommodating
pastor&rdquo; in its most literal sense.&nbsp; He had been told
in the ordination charge not only &ldquo;to feed the flock, but
to <i>drive away</i> the grievous wolves&rdquo;; an exhortation
which permitted of a mischievous application.&nbsp; The writer of
this sketch dare not indulge <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>in comments on the impatience of
youth, and there is very little evidence of any kind in the
Church records.&nbsp; But what there is is all in John
Clayton&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; The Church was by no means clear of
the commercial spirit.&nbsp; The only view of its functions still
held by many was that it was a society for managing certain
business in connection with the expenses of public worship.&nbsp;
That such questions must inevitably arise, and that they should
be discussed and answered from a Christian standpoint, is beyond
dispute.&nbsp; But it says much for John Clayton that the
constant intrusion of the merely financial element, and the
failure of those in authority to realise the spiritual mission of
the Church, caused him such concern, that he felt compelled to
resign his ministry.&nbsp; Possibly he was unprepared for the
necessarily slow and difficult work of permeating <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>a society of
characteristically business men with the deepest religious
spirit.&nbsp; The membership of the Church stood still.&nbsp; Mr.
Clayton said that he found his sentiments on many subjects, but
especially that of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, opposed to those of
many of the members.&nbsp; He was not himself a man who would be
easily carried away with a rush of enthusiasm, and hence he did
not carry away others.&nbsp; God was, even then, preparing just
such a man to break down the unspirituality of the congregation,
and to build up a higher form of Christian society in Kensington;
and this man was still at college when John Clayton&rsquo;s
resignation was accepted in December, 1804.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span><span
class="smcap">If</span> the congregation at Kensington felt that
John Clayton acted with something of the rashness and impatience
of youth, there was at least no sign that they so regarded it:
for after unsuccessful overtures had been made to the Rev. F.
Hamilton, of Brighton, to become successor to Mr. Clayton, they
turned to another young man fresh from college, whose name was
John Leifchild.&nbsp; After patiently waiting until he had
completed the few remaining months of his college <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>course, they
welcomed him to the pastorate in June, 1808; and a very
remarkable ministry then began.&nbsp; It is impossible to feel
surprise at Mr. Leifchild&rsquo;s frank avowal of the defects of
the congregation considered as a spiritual society.&nbsp; Any one
who has wearily made his way through the minutes in the
church-book relating to this period, might be pardoned for
concluding that no spiritual body existed at all.&nbsp; The
government of the church was in the hands of a small coterie of
managers; and the records consist of an uninspiring succession of
financial statistics and plans for raising money.&nbsp; To those
of us who are more interested in the character of the Church than
in the idiosyncrasies of any particular minister, these accounts
are not good to read.&nbsp; Mr. Leifchild says, &ldquo;There was
a great prejudice in the town against the Dissenters&rdquo;; <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>and one can
hardly wonder at that when we remember that Dissenters can only
justify their existence as Dissenters by the superiority of their
spiritual thought and work: and of this at present there is but
too little trace in the history that we have received.&nbsp; But
in every way&mdash;patience, perseverance, tact and
courage&mdash;John Leifchild was just the man to inaugurate a
better era.&nbsp; At this time the church made a resolute and
successful endeavour to liquidate the old debt on the buildings:
and then, after the manner of high-spirited communities,
proceeded to contract a new one.&nbsp; The young minister had
almost immediately attained considerable popularity, and a back
gallery had to be erected.&nbsp; In a short time side galleries
had to be added, to accommodate the people who desired to worship
at Hornton Street Chapel.&nbsp; <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>All these alterations involved the
congregation in somewhat expensive liabilities, and, in addition,
the incidental expenditure had not been met.&nbsp; These were
only the necessary penalties of success, and it was quite clear
that all would come right in time.&nbsp; But the financial
apprehensions of the managers were excited; and they actually
formulated proposals for taxing the seat-holders, inserting in
their plan, however, a suitable declaration of their devotion to
the voluntary principle.&nbsp; The proposals were overthrown by
the unwavering resistance of Mr. Leifchild, and the voluntary
principle, fairly applied, proved more than adequate to the
necessities of the time.</p>
<p>Our Sunday Schools to-day are such a notable feature of
Kensington Chapel, that it is interesting to find a record of
this kind, dated February 22nd, 1814: &ldquo;Resolved&mdash;In
consequence <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>of no other place being found so convenient as the
<i>vault</i> under the chapel for a Sunday School, that we take
the same into consideration.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are sometimes
tempted to complain of the discomforts of our present buildings,
but those who began the work had to do it obviously under
difficulties of which we know little.&nbsp; The managers,
however, could not finally consent to bury the Sunday School in
the vault,&mdash;and hence, by the removal of the staircase, a
room was fitted up under the back gallery, and here the Sunday
School was very narrowly housed.&nbsp; This important question
having been thus disposed of, a more serious problem
arose&mdash;that of music.&nbsp; There was at this time no organ;
but it was natural that one so distinguished in the musical world
as Mr. Broadwood should desire the introduction of a suitable
instrument.&nbsp; Mr. Broadwood <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>not only desired it; but he was
liberal enough to offer to present an organ to the chapel.&nbsp;
The conscientious objection to instrumental music in religious
buildings is now, for the most part, ancient history.&nbsp; But
feeling ran high on the question in the days I am writing of, and
one &ldquo;true-blue Presbyterian,&rdquo; as Dr. Stoughton calls
him, would have none of the new-fangled methods, and retired with
his family from the scene, entering his protest against the whole
proceedings in stout British fashion.&nbsp; Mr. Broadwood gave
the organ; and the treasurer had great difficulty, apparently, in
paying the organist; and, what with periodical discontinuance of
the organ on the score of expense, and criticism of the organist
by the congregation, the musical affairs were far from smooth and
pleasant for some time to come.&nbsp; Kensington music has never
ceased to be a <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>source of anxious solicitude to the Church from that day
to this.</p>
<p>Many are the stories of Mr. Leifchild&rsquo;s power of
preaching, and it is evident that he prepared his discourses with
great care.&nbsp; His method of delivery was somewhat singular,
and we should be inclined to regard it as artificial.&nbsp; But
it was capable of great effect.&nbsp; The main portion of the
discourse was delivered in a quiet, conversational tone, and was
occupied in doctrinal, or exegetical, exposition.&nbsp; The
audience listened languidly, if not drowsily.&nbsp; But suddenly
there was an awakening.&nbsp; The preacher was approaching his
application.&nbsp; Standing full back in the pulpit, and
mustering all his energy, he proceeded to declaim the final
passages of the sermon.&nbsp; In these he drove home the truths
he had elicited in exposition with amazing force.&nbsp; The <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>congregation
was now listening with breathless interest.&nbsp; This was what
they had come to hear; and they were simply at the
preacher&rsquo;s mercy for the remainder of his discourse.&nbsp;
This old style of preaching has almost entirely, if not
altogether, disappeared.&nbsp; But it was a great power in those
days, and there were few more absolute masters of the art than
John Leifchild.&nbsp; There are still two members connected with
Kensington Chapel who were in Mr. Leifchild&rsquo;s Bible
Class.</p>
<p>After sixteen years of faithful ministry, Mr. Leifchild
accepted a call to Bristol, and left amid genuine expressions of
regret.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that, immediately after
his departure, the minutes, which have only recorded
&ldquo;Managers&rsquo; meetings,&rdquo; change to
&ldquo;Managers&rsquo; and Deacons&rsquo; meetings.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The introduction of the spiritual order of office-bearers <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>is not
without significance.&nbsp; Neither is the fact that the next
minister was invited, not by the subscribers and trustees, but by
the Church.&nbsp; Evidently &ldquo;the old order changeth,
yielding place to new&rdquo;; and John Leifchild&rsquo;s greatest
success was his last&mdash;for we can hardly doubt that it was
his&mdash;when the spiritual order superseded the purely business
order, and the power of a body of managers gave way to the
authority of a Church of Christ.</p>

<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span><span
class="smcap">In</span> the minutes that describe the events
immediately succeeding the resignation of Mr. Leifchild, in
August, 1824, there are several references to the institution of
a Church Prayer Meeting.&nbsp; Such an anxious period as
inevitably follows the loss of a minister is often a valuable
discipline to a Church, as tending to throw the members back upon
the guidance of the Spirit of God.&nbsp; That the Church at
Kensington had realised the need to consult, not only with one
another, but with the All-wise, was the best possible augury of
prosperity to come.&nbsp; And, <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>verily, God did choose for
them.&nbsp; Dr. Robert Vaughan was a very different man in many
ways from Mr. Leifchild, but no one could have been more
admirably adapted to continue and develop the work that the
Church had hitherto been doing.&nbsp; He had all the instincts
and tastes of a scholar; and as a brilliant historical writer he
exercised a wider ministry, and influenced a larger circle, than
if he had simply exercised his gifts as a preacher in the Hornton
Street pulpit.&nbsp; So considerable was his fame that he was
appointed Professor of Modern History at London University; and,
with the generosity which has always characterised the Kensington
congregation in such matters, his people spared him gladly much
of the labour of visitation, for the sake of the services he was
thus able to render to the rising generation of Londoners.&nbsp;
Kensington was now assuming the character <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>it has ever
since possessed, of a great residential suburb for aristocratic
and wealthy London.&nbsp; There was a large circle of able and
cultivated men and women to be reached and influenced by the
attraction of one, whose personal attainments and powers were
sufficiently remarkable to overcome the strong prejudices against
Dissenting meeting-places that have always existed in the minds
of such.&nbsp; This power Dr. Vaughan possessed and exercised:
while at the same time his personal elevation of character, and
rare spiritual earnestness, qualified him pre-eminently to be a
guide to all who knew him in &ldquo;the deep things of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are consequently quite prepared to find that
the little meeting-house in Hornton Street was a centre of light
and leading to a large number of men and women who occupied
prominent positions in society and in the <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>professions.&nbsp; And yet the last accusation that
could be levelled against Dr. Vaughan was that of a
&ldquo;tuft-hunter.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not <i>stoop</i> to
conquer, in the sense of descending to any unworthy artifices: he
flattered no one; and his reputation as one of the great
historians of Nonconformity is sufficient assurance that he never
betrayed his trust as a custodian of the sacred interests of
religious freedom.</p>
<p>One of the signs of the earnestness of the Church at this
time, in seeking to perpetuate the principles for which it stood,
was the constant interest manifested in the work of the British
Schools, for which Dr. Vaughan repeatedly preached special
sermons.&nbsp; The school used to meet in a building at the back
of Hornton Street Chapel.&nbsp; No attempt was made to
indoctrinate the infant mind with denominational ideas; but, on
the other <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>hand, such religious instruction was given as is clearly
to be gathered from the study of the Bible, and any child could
be educated there without being required to learn by heart the
exceedingly questionable teaching of the Church Catechism.&nbsp;
For a long period of years these schools remained in very close
touch with the Congregational Church, and were only eventually
transferred to the management of the School Board when the
general scheme of religious education, under the Board, was seen
to be thoroughly in harmony with what had prevailed so long in
the British Schools.</p>
<p>It is by such simple notices as those concerning the British
Schools, the Missionary Society, the Sunday Schools, and other
institutions, that we can form our idea of the many interests
that were beginning to take <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>possession of the hearts of the
people.&nbsp; The records during Dr. Vaughan&rsquo;s ministry are
singularly imperfect, and it is only quite incidentally that we
get some impression of the steadily increasing prosperity of the
cause.&nbsp; For eighteen years Dr. Vaughan continued his
ministry, and there is not a single evidence of a moment&rsquo;s
break in the harmony of the Church.&nbsp; When, in 1843, Dr.
Vaughan was honoured with an invitation to become Principal of
the Lancashire Independent College, the letters of himself and of
the Church were such as became those who had lived and worked so
long together in the most honourable spirit of Christian
fellowship.&nbsp; The letter of the Church is exceedingly
touching in its anxiety to express to the full its ardent and
affectionate attachment to Dr. Vaughan, and yet to do nothing to
add to the necessary <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>pain and anxiety of his
decision.&nbsp; Dr. Vaughan felt that the call to Lancashire was
of God, and he placed his resignation in the hands of the
Church.&nbsp; But even then, his interest in their welfare was
unabated; and he knew the perils of a time of unsettlement.&nbsp;
There was one well known to him, and to whom he was related by
many affinities of thought and sympathy, who was labouring at
that time in a sphere of less influence at Windsor; and, before
he left Kensington, he approached Dr. John Stoughton, and
obtained from him the promise that he would consent to preach
before the Kensington congregation.&nbsp; Two months afterwards
Dr. Stoughton accepted a unanimous invitation from the Church,
and commenced his ministry.&nbsp; Before closing this chapter,
one word must be added.&nbsp; There are many sacred memories
connected with Hornton <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Street Chapel, and those who used to
worship there; but none more sacred to all who honour those in
whom pure genius stands united to simple faith and devout
spirituality, than those associated with the name of Robert
Alfred Vaughan.&nbsp; He was the beloved son of Dr. Vaughan, and
the highest hopes were cherished for him by a large circle of
religious and literary men.&nbsp; He entered the Congregational
ministry, and gave to the world a work of the greatest promise,
entitled &ldquo;Hours with the Mystics.&rdquo;&nbsp; His own
beautiful spirit breathed through every page.&nbsp; But his work
was too arduous, and he died in early manhood.&nbsp; It has been
said that if he had avoided the fatigue of constant pastoral
duty, he might have lived on to do brilliant intellectual
work.&nbsp; It may be so.&nbsp; But perhaps he chose the better
part, and did the greater work, as will <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>one day be
known.&nbsp; At any rate, he has left us his own answer, in what
has been called his &ldquo;Psalm of Life.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And thou canst not in life&rsquo;s city<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule thy course as in a cell:<br />
There are others, all thy brothers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who have work to do as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some events that mar thy purpose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May light <i>them</i> upon their way;<br />
Our sun&mdash;shining, in declining&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives earth&rsquo;s other side the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every star is drawn and draweth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mid the orbits of its peers;<br />
And the blending thus unending<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes the music of the spheres.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of Robert Alfred Vaughan we still love to conjecture what he
<i>is</i>, or, as some prefer to put it, what he would have been
if he had lived.&nbsp; He was the Arthur Hallam of
Nonconformity.</p>

class="smcap">The</span> succession of Dr. Stoughton to the
ministry of the Church brings us exactly to the middle of our
century of history.&nbsp; In October, 1843, the recognition
service was held.&nbsp; Dr. Stoughton, in his letter accepting
the invitation, had feelingly referred to the difficulty of
following Dr. Vaughan, &ldquo;one whose eminence in the Christian
world might well provoke, in connection with myself, humiliating
comparisons.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, indeed, the Church had been guided
to one of the very few men who might fittingly <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>continue the
work of Dr. Vaughan.&nbsp; As a historian of those periods of
English history in which Nonconformists are especially
interested, Dr. Stoughton stands unsurpassed among Englishmen;
and such is the fairness and moderation of his writings that
Church of England lecturers have repeatedly made appeal to them
as models of impartial and accurate statement.&nbsp; Indeed, Dr.
Stoughton&rsquo;s literary industry has been immense.&nbsp; The
Religious Tract Society has largely benefited by admirably
written accounts of the great Reformers and religious heroes of
Christendom, while Dr. Stoughton&rsquo;s editorship of the
<i>Evangelical Magazine</i> was conspicuously successful in
making that organ a power among the Churches.&nbsp; But it was in
no partial or half-hearted way that he threw himself into his
ministerial work at Kensington.&nbsp; Our readers must turn to <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>his own
inimitable narrative in &ldquo;Congregationalism in the Court
Suburb&rdquo; for the delightful reminiscences he gives of his
own ministry, and the people associated with it.&nbsp; Our
concern is with the growth of the Church life; and to this end we
must pursue our examination of the records, which are henceforth
admirably kept.</p>
<p>That Dr. Stoughton immediately acquired the full confidence
and loyal support of the Church officers and members is evident
from a very remarkable fact.&nbsp; For many years past the Church
had been, in all essential procedure, a Congregational Church;
but, although it was so in fact, it was not so actually in
form.&nbsp; The members had apparently not been led to see the
importance of constituting themselves according to the New
Testament practice.&nbsp; We all know that it is not easy to
carry out <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>important changes without arousing considerable
criticism, and, not unusually, opposition.&nbsp; And for the
truer fashioning of the Church upon more Apostolic lines there
was needed a strong and wise leadership.&nbsp; This leadership
was supplied by the new minister, and the delicate work of
reorganisation was most successfully and harmoniously carried
through.&nbsp; The existing &ldquo;managers&rdquo; became
deacons, and new deacons were appointed; and the Church assumed
the form which it has ever since maintained.&nbsp; It was of
excellent augury for the success of his ministry that Dr.
Stoughton perceived so early that the recognition of the
spiritual order of the Church in form, as well as in fact, was a
vital principle.&nbsp; However much of the subsequent development
of our Church we may attribute to Dr. Stoughton&rsquo;s able and
devoted ministry, we are bound to <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>attribute even more to this bold and
timely assertion of the true idea of the Church.</p>
<p>The time soon came when the Hornton Street Chapel proved too
small for the number of hearers.&nbsp; Kensington was, even now,
rapidly developing, and every month added to the congregations
that assembled to worship in what was never a large
building.&nbsp; What enlargement could easily be made was carried
out in 1845, but it afforded only temporary relief.&nbsp; There
had evidently come to the Church one of those testing times of
faith and sacrifice which prove the genuineness of the spirit and
the life.&nbsp; The district of Notting Hill was becoming an
influential and populous one, and the conviction was laying hold
of the minds and hearts of many, that it was a clear duty to
Christ that a certain number of the members should consent to
break with the old <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>associations of Hornton Street, and form a new Church in
the district just mentioned.&nbsp; Such a proposal, of course,
meant even more than the severance of very sacred ties that bound
them to the old society, and to their loved minister.&nbsp; It
meant a generous offering of their money for the new
building.&nbsp; But to all these demands the Church was
equal.&nbsp; At a meeting held in the vestry at Hornton Street,
&pound;1700 was at once subscribed, and, in a very tender and
beautiful document, that betrays in every line the sorrow that
they felt at thus going forth from a place and a community so
dear to them, thirty-seven members ask to be commissioned by the
Hornton Street Church to form a new society at Horbury, Notting
Hill.&nbsp; An exodus of this kind, where the spirit is entirely
of love and faith, is a memorable and impressive event.&nbsp;
Something like one hundred <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>seat-holders left Hornton Street for
Horbury; but the two congregations remained one in heart, as they
were one in tradition.&nbsp; Under the long and able ministry of
the Rev. William Roberts, the Horbury Church has been a great
power for good in that neighbourhood.&nbsp; We reproduce a
photograph of the chapel, which stands on an admirable site, and
presents a very good appearance.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On purely economical principles the mother Church should now
be seriously weakened by the voluntary surrender of so many
members, and so much earnest Christian capacity.&nbsp; But the
great law of the economy of the Kingdom of Heaven is that we live
by sacrifice.&nbsp; And it was so now.&nbsp; The Church at
Hornton Street flourished as never before.&nbsp; The income was
not impaired: the sittings refilled; the organisations abounded
with life.&nbsp; In influence, <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>reputation, and spiritual power, the
Church grew day by day.&nbsp; Not five years afterwards, the old
problem of enlarging the accommodation presented itself once more
for solution.&nbsp; The time was hardly ripe, nor was any special
neighbourhood obvious, for planting a new settlement.&nbsp;
Consequently the alternative solution remained.&nbsp; There must
be a new and larger edifice built.&nbsp; The spirit of the
people, so far from being daunted by the prospect of a large
expenditure, and all the infinite cares of chapel building, rose
to meet the opportunity.&nbsp; The site at Allen Street was
secured, and in June, 1854, Dr. Stoughton laid the first stone of
Kensington Chapel.&nbsp; In May, 1855, the building was opened,
and in January, 1860, it was paid for, the total cost of land and
building being &pound;8748 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The plain
and severe character of the interior <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>probably represented, even then, the
average Nonconformist taste in regard to chapel
architecture.&nbsp; &AElig;sthetically considered, it is no doubt
indefensible.&nbsp; The windows are undeniably ugly; the
pulpit&mdash;designed as a firm remonstrance against locomotion
on the part of its occupant&mdash;is painfully stiff and square;
and the general aspect of the building is somewhat dull and
prosaic.&nbsp; But, as a suitable and convenient place for
Nonconformist worship, there is very much to be said for this
form of building.&nbsp; Every one can see the preacher, and he
can see every one.&nbsp; The acoustic properties are
perfect.&nbsp; Nothing interferes with the enjoyment of speaking
and hearing: no handsome but troublesome pillars interrupt the
sight; and, let us add, when it is well filled, many of its most
obvious defects entirely disappear.</p>
<p>There is no need to trace in anything like <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>detail the
steady progress of the Church in its new habitation.&nbsp; In
1856 the Lecture Hall was built, and has been an indispensable
adjunct to the Church buildings since that time.&nbsp; In 1868
the Church took into consideration the need for larger buildings
to contain the British Schools, and shortly afterwards the
friends of the Schools began the building that now stands next to
Kensington Chapel, and is the meeting-place of our Sunday
Schools.&nbsp; Thus the years were full of work and growth in
many directions, and the utmost harmony prevailed among the
members, while the relationship of pastor and people grew closer
and more affectionate as the time rolled by.&nbsp; In course of
time the Church provided an assistant minister to relieve Dr.
Stoughton of some part of the labour.&nbsp; The arrangement
worked harmoniously <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>and fairly successfully.&nbsp; But Dr. Stoughton had
come to feel that this was not a permanent settlement of the
question that was arising, how best to provide for the pastoral
supervision of the people, as well as for the superintendence of
the numerous important organisations connected with the
Church.&nbsp; Through thirty years of faithful ministerial
labour, assisted by the harmonious co-operation of a devoted
people, Dr. Stoughton had led the Church forward, step by step,
into a position of exceptional strength and influence.&nbsp; It
was not unnatural that, having borne the burden and heat of the
day so faithfully and so long, he should desire to be released
from the full responsibilities of the pastorate.&nbsp; But it was
two years later before his deeply attached people could consent
to the severance of a tie that had become so sacred.&nbsp; <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>The
retirement of Dr. Stoughton from the pastorate of the Church
evoked demonstrations of respect and affection that we do not
hesitate to term unique.&nbsp; At the public meeting in the
chapel, on April 8th, 1875, to say farewell, there was a most
remarkable assemblage of honoured men.&nbsp; Mr. Samuel Morley
occupied the chair, and Sir Thomas Chambers, Mr. Henry Richard,
Sir Charles Reed, Dean Stanley, Canon Fremantle, Dr. Morley
Punshon, Dr. Angus, Dr. Henry Allon, and the Rev. Baldwin Brown
were among those who took part in the meeting.&nbsp; An address,
expressive of admiration and regard for Dr. Stoughton, and
gratitude for his devoted ministry, was presented to him,
accompanied by a purse containing &pound;3000.&nbsp; Thus closed
a most memorable ministry.&nbsp; But it is one of the special
joys of our centenary services that <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Dr. Stoughton should still be able to
come among us, to celebrate the fiftieth year of his association
with Kensington.&nbsp; He retired full of honours.&nbsp; His
great qualities, alike of literary ability and personal
character, won for him the unique distinction of being elected by
those most eminent in the various branches of our national
life&mdash;Politics, Art, Science, and Literature&mdash;to
membership of the Athen&aelig;um Club.&nbsp; We believe that he
alone of all Nonconformist ministers has been welcomed to this
honour.&nbsp; But we are certainly right in saying that, even
more than such a mark of recognition by men distinguished in so
many walks of life, he has valued the simple love and loyalty of
that Christian Church to which he gave himself with such
unqualified devotion, and which owes so much of its present
character and influence to the spiritual leadership of Dr.
Stoughton.</p>

<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>A
<span class="smcap">distinguished</span> living preacher once
said to his congregation that his work would only be done when he
had taught them to do without him.&nbsp; It is a true test of the
soundness of a minister&rsquo;s work when the congregation does
not break up, nor even suffer loss at his withdrawal, but, in the
spirit of faith and prayer and counsel, addresses itself to the
delicate work of seeking a successor.&nbsp; A congregation, that
for thirty-two years had enjoyed the ministry of so able a man as
Dr. Stoughton, might have almost <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>been forgiven, had it manifested
some indecision when his guidance was withdrawn.&nbsp; But a true
Independent Church is trained to habits of self-government; and
at the critical periods of its history these habits are its
protection and salvation.&nbsp; After unavailing efforts had been
made to induce the Rev. G. S. Barrett, B.A., of Norwich, to
accept the pastorate, the thought of the Church was directed to
one whose name will ever be fragrant in the memory of the Church
of Christ, Dr. Alexander Raleigh.&nbsp; At this time Dr. Raleigh
was exercising his ministry in connection with two associated
churches in Highbury; and only the strain of this exceptional
work upon one of his advancing years could justify him in
listening to any proposals that he should move westward.&nbsp;
The work at Highbury was in the highest degree fruitful: but it
was evident that Dr. Raleigh&rsquo;s <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>health was on the verge of breaking
down; and when the cordial and unanimous call of the Kensington
Church reached him he gave it earnest and anxious consideration,
and finally determined to accept it.</p>
<p>In this way there was consummated a union of which those who
were privileged to share in it speak to this day in the most
tender and grateful terms.&nbsp; One feels that the very chapel
has been hallowed and consecrated by the closing years of a
beautiful ministry&mdash;years which brought with them all the
radiant hues and tints of autumn.&nbsp; The story of these years,
as, indeed, of the whole life of Alexander Raleigh, has been so
inimitably written by his wife, that it has become a classic
among Nonconformist biographies; and there are few libraries
among us on the shelves of which there are not to be found
&ldquo;Quiet Resting-places,&rdquo; <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>&ldquo;The Little Sanctuary,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Book of Esther,&rdquo; or some other volume of those
exquisitely finished and spiritual sermons which will embody the
spirit of Alexander Raleigh for all future generations.&nbsp; Dr.
Raleigh, especially at this period of his life, had an
indefinable grace of spiritual repose and inward peace, which
communicated itself to those who came under his influence.&nbsp;
Not that he was a Quietist.&nbsp; He was an ardent politician,
and never ceased to take a profound and practical interest in
questions of national importance.&nbsp; He was an impassioned
preacher of righteousness; and a robust and uncompromising
Nonconformist.&nbsp; But controversy did not disturb his deep
inward peace of spirit; and while it is true that, like the great
Independent of earlier days,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;His
heart<br />
The lowliest duties on herself did lay&rdquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>it
could also be said of him,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thy soul was like a star and dwelt
apart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it would be impossible to speak of Dr. Raleigh&rsquo;s
work at Kensington without speaking of Mrs. Raleigh&rsquo;s work
also.&nbsp; It is still a red-letter day in the experience of
many at Kensington Chapel when Mrs. Raleigh revisits those in
whose hearts she has so large a place, and to many of whom she
made real the most sacred beliefs of Christianity.&nbsp; Mrs.
Raleigh gathered a large Bible Class, which still continues to
assemble in the Deacons&rsquo; Vestry on Sunday afternoons, and
comprises not only elder girls and young women, but those who
would not be offended if they were called elderly.&nbsp; The
character of her influence over this class, and over all in the
congregation who knew her&mdash;and who did not?&mdash;needs to
be actually known to be adequately appreciated.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>The
congregations, under Dr. Raleigh&rsquo;s inspiring ministry,
filled the large chapel in every part.&nbsp; And, with this
growth in the congregation, it must have been very encouraging,
to all who were interested, to mark the growth in the
Church.&nbsp; At one time forty-three members are recorded as
having joined the Church, at another time thirty, at another
twenty-five, and so on.&nbsp; Many who were of Scotch extraction
found their patriotism too strong even for denominational
preferences, and came great distances to hear
&ldquo;Raleigh&rdquo; at Kensington.&nbsp; Brief as his ministry
was&mdash;too brief, we say, with our imperfect
conceptions&mdash;it was yet long enough to leave an indelible
impression on numbers of his hearers, who will bear the marks of
his fashioning to all eternity.&nbsp; His successors in the
ministry here alone know, perhaps, how deep and abiding was the
spiritual work done in those five years.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>That,
in the enjoyment of these rare spiritual privileges, the Church
did not become self-centred, is manifest, not only in the steady
interest in missionary and philanthropic work, but in the
initiation of a movement, which was not realised until later, for
planting a new church at West Kensington.&nbsp; With
characteristic generosity Dr. Raleigh welcomed the proposal, but
it was not given to him to do more than &ldquo;greet the promise
afar.&rdquo;&nbsp; The shadow was even now beginning to fall upon
him; yet those who had been most apprehensive of a serious
breakdown in his health learned with something of stupefaction
the doctors&rsquo; verdict that recovery was impossible.&nbsp;
There is a deeply pathetic suggestiveness associated with the
fact that the last sermon he preached was from the text,
&ldquo;And Enoch walked with God: and he was not, for God <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>took
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Possibly some premonition of the end had come
to him; possibly a Higher than he had put the words into his
heart for his final address to his beloved people.&nbsp; For the
touching story of his last days, we shall still turn to the
beautiful narrative of Mrs. Raleigh.&nbsp; It is not too much to
say that not only all Congregationalists everywhere kept
sympathetic watch, as it were, around the sick-bed; but the
larger Church of Christ listened anxiously for tidings of the
progress of the invalid.&nbsp; And progress it was, but progress
heavenward.&nbsp; Shortly after noon on Monday, April 19th, 1880,
he passed away; and, for the first time in its history, Death had
sealed the ministry of a pastor of the Kensington Church while he
was still in its service.&nbsp; There is a holy discipline for a
Church in such a deep common sorrow, such as not the most
eloquent <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>preaching can convey.&nbsp; The &ldquo;still&rdquo;
voice speaks louder even than the strong full voice of
life.&nbsp; It is good sometimes for the soul of a people to be
humbled by a great grief.&nbsp; At no past time had an experience
so searching as this come to the Church at Kensington.&nbsp; Its
pastors had left it for other work and other spheres.&nbsp; But
this one had died among them; in the very ripeness of his powers
he had passed away.&nbsp; All the demonstrations of their sorrow
were but a weak expression of what they felt.&nbsp; And yet there
was a meaning in the visitation; and one cannot doubt that out of
their minister&rsquo;s cheerful serenity, and calm and tranquil
&ldquo;exodus,&rdquo; God wrought for them a quickening of
faith.&nbsp; For of Alexander Raleigh it might well be said that
the &ldquo;manner of his passing&rdquo; was an &ldquo;evidence of
the things unseen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> buries His
workers, but carries on His work.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is this faith
that leads a Church, even under the shock of a bereavement as
severe as this one had been, to turn with unabated determination
to the prosecution of the work.&nbsp; The more nearly a Church of
Christ attains the standard of the Master, the less it depends on
any mere human instrumentality for its success.&nbsp; It is not
the person of the preacher, but the Person of the Christ and the
love of His work, that forms the sacred tie <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>between the
members.&nbsp; This it is that prevents the work of God from
suffering, and gives permanence to His cause.&nbsp; It was truly
with a sad heart that the Church assembled at this time to
consult about a successor to Dr. Raleigh; but the claims of
&ldquo;the work&rdquo; were paramount, and there was a plain but
difficult duty before them.&nbsp; Our critics are not slow to
remind us that the gravest defect of the Congregational system
lies in the fact that, during the period when a church is without
a minister, a system of competition among rival candidates is
pursued, which is humiliating to the self-respect of those who
preach, and calculated to provoke division and contention among
those who sit in judgment.&nbsp; This evil is, we believe, being
resolutely redressed in most of our Churches to-day, and the
Kensington Church has never suffered from it at any <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>period of
its history.&nbsp; A trusted committee made careful inquiries
with a view to discovering some minister who seemed to be
adapted, alike in character and abilities, to the special wants
of this neighbourhood.&nbsp; Opportunity was then sought of
introducing him to the pulpit, and if he manifestly commended
himself to the whole Church&mdash;and not a mere majority of the
Church&mdash;he was invited to become the minister.&nbsp; This
admirable plan has averted anything like the evils sometimes
associated with a change of pastorate.&nbsp; In the instance
before us the committee&rsquo;s attention was directed to the
eminently successful ministry of the Rev. Colmer B. Symes, B.A.,
of Exeter.&nbsp; In that corner of England Mr. Symes had most
worthily maintained for several years the office of the Christian
ministry, and had exercised a great power for good.&nbsp; All who
knew him esteemed <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>him for the loftiness of his Christian character, as
well as for his ministerial gifts.&nbsp; As a man of culture and
wide reading, he seemed to be conspicuously suited to the special
needs of a locality, where the problems of modern thought
occupied the minds of a large proportion of the population.&nbsp;
Mr. Symes preached at Kensington, with no intention whatever of
being a &ldquo;candidate&rdquo;: but as there was an immediate
response to his message, a unanimous invitation was sent to him
to become the pastor of the Church, and in January, 1881, Mr.
Symes was recognised as the minister.&nbsp; The Church records
contain many testimonies to the power of the ministry thus
begun.&nbsp; The number of Church members steadily grew.&nbsp;
The monthly Church meetings were times of continual rejoicing
over accessions to the ranks of those who had solemnly taken the
sacred pledge of <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>loyalty to Christ.&nbsp; So high was the spirit of the
Church, that, in the second year of Mr. Symes&rsquo; ministry, it
was decided vigorously to pursue the movement, initiated in Dr.
Raleigh&rsquo;s pastorate, of building a new Congregational
church at West Kensington.&nbsp; Nothing was more characteristic
of the new minister than the cordiality with which he furthered a
scheme that must inevitably diminish, at any rate for a time, his
own Church and congregation.&nbsp; Thinking, rather, of the
necessities of the rapidly growing neighbourhood of West
Kensington, Mr. Symes and his Church threw themselves nobly into
the enterprise.&nbsp; At a meeting held in the Vestry Hall,
Kensington, it was announced that no less a sum than
&pound;12,084 had been promised, and the whole cost of over
&pound;15,000 was raised at the opening of the church.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Not
thirty years had passed since the opening of Allen Street Chapel,
but the new church at West Kensington would seem to indicate a
remarkable change in taste and idea as regards the character of
ecclesiastical buildings.&nbsp; It is a conspicuously handsome
building, with a massive central tower, a chancel, and a general
elegance of structure not unworthy to rank among the very best of
modern Nonconformist Church edifices.&nbsp; We are all of us
familiar with the natural law which leads parents to be far more
lavish in expenditure for their children than for
themselves.&nbsp; We are consequently not surprised to find that
the Church at Allen Street spent twice as much on a building for
this child of its own training as it did on the building in which
the mother Church still worships.&nbsp; At a special Church
meeting, that strikingly recalls <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the moving and interesting gathering
when the first branch Church removed from Kensington to Notting
Hill, nearly thirty members took a farewell of Allen Street, and
went to the new and difficult work of building up a strong church
in West Kensington; and with them went naturally a considerable
number of seat-holders, supported in their action by the generous
encouragement of the Allen Street minister.&nbsp; Thus the second
colony was planted from the mother Church.&nbsp; She had given
lavishly of her own life and treasure for the enrichment of
others; and by the eternal law of the Cross she reaped her reward
in the fuller and deeper life bestowed upon those who
remained.&nbsp; There only remains to add that, after years of
hard and discouraging labour, the new Church appears to be slowly
and steadily rooting itself, and to be <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>destined to
become a spiritual power in the locality.</p>
<p>Uneventful years followed.&nbsp; Those who best know the
character of modern Kensington are best able to appreciate the
difficulty there is of gathering a strong evening
congregation.&nbsp; With his previous successful experience at
Exeter so fresh in his memory, it is no wonder that Mr. Symes
felt, even more acutely than many do who are called to minister
in the West of London, this grave discouragement to the
preacher.&nbsp; Many of his expedients to meet the difficulty
were for a time successful.&nbsp; Largely-attended evangelistic
services were periodically held; but the permanent evening
congregation did not grow.&nbsp; Still more serious a problem to
one of Mr. Symes&rsquo; intensely earnest temperament was the
decline in the number of those who were led <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>to public
acknowledgment of a change of life.&nbsp; He could not reconcile
his own conception of what justifies a ministry in any place with
the absence of this note of success; and hence, in a
characteristically beautiful letter to the Church in March, 1887,
he placed his resignation in their hands.&nbsp; The remarkable
meeting at which the congregation presented to Mr. Symes a large
portrait in oils of himself, and an illuminated address, was the
occasion of a demonstration of the affection and regard in which
he was universally held.&nbsp; There have been resignations of
ministers who have been determined in their action by a variety
of considerations that have led them to give the preference to
one sphere of labour over another.&nbsp; But surely the highest
of all considerations is contained in so deep a sense of the
spiritual mission of the minister, and in so lofty an ideal <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>of his
work, that even a qualified response to the public and private
ministrations suggests that a continuance of the ministry may
cause the interests of the Kingdom to suffer.&nbsp; The
Kensington Church had had many lessons before this time, from
those who had made great and cheerful sacrifices for its
interests; but such a lesson was never taught it with more of
real Christian dignity and chivalry than when Mr. Symes laid down
the office of minister; thus ending a six years&rsquo; pastorate
for which very many of the congregation to-day continue to thank
God.</p>

<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span><span
class="smcap">At</span> the time of Mr. Symes&rsquo; resignation,
the present minister of the church was a freshman at College, and
a good deal more occupied with studies and athletics than with
any question of settling in the ministry.&nbsp; It was not really
a surprising thing to those who knew the traditions of Kensington
Chapel, that a Church that had chosen John Clayton when he was
twenty-one, and that had waited for Mr. Leifchild until he had
completed his college course, should elect to wait nearly two
years for its present minister.&nbsp; The course was <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>an unusual
one, but it had one conspicuous advantage.&nbsp; It enabled the
Church to enjoy for eighteen months the ministry of the Rev.
Edward White.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to explain to any one who
knows any thing of Congregationalism, or the history of
theological thought during the last half century, who Mr. Edward
White is.&nbsp; There had been a time when he was suspected and
misunderstood, for having interpreted the teaching of Scripture
on one point in a sense different from the majority of his
brethren.&nbsp; But we live in happier days, when our joy is to
dwell rather on our substantial unity than on points of different
interpretation.&nbsp; Mr. White has won the recognition of the
whole Catholic Church as a stalwart standard-bearer in the
&ldquo;good fight of faith&rdquo;; and great was the satisfaction
at Kensington, when one who was just <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>retiring from an arduous and
remarkable ministry at Kentish Town was willing to give himself
to the superintendence of the work at Kensington, until the
minister-elect had completed his college training.</p>
<p>The result of this arrangement was exceedingly happy.&nbsp; We
believe Mr. White was rewarded by the multitude of new friends
that he thus made; and the congregation was abundantly rewarded,
not only by the steady advance in interest that was made during
the time of Mr. White&rsquo;s ministry, but by the securing for
itself of the sympathy and affection of such a friend as Mr.
White has been.&nbsp; The young men remember to-day with the
keenest relish the good times they had in Mr. White&rsquo;s Bible
Class; and, indeed, he has only to appear among us to evoke the
loudest demonstrations of welcome.&nbsp; But <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>in nothing
did his loving and genial spirit appear more characteristically
than in his relations with the one who was appointed to succeed
him in the ministry at Kensington.&nbsp; The writer of this book
records here the lasting debt of gratitude he is under to Mr.
White for tender and helpful counsel and loving encouragement,
such as he can never cease to remember with filial reverence and
thankfulness.</p>
<p>The minister of a Church such as ours is always interested in
discovering the &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; of well-remembered sayings
and stories of the various ministers and prominent laymen that
have been associated with the place.&nbsp; There grows up in this
way a kind of Rabbinical tradition; and you can often estimate
the force of character in a minister by the way in which people
treasure up the memories of <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>what he said and did.&nbsp; Mr.
White added materially to the oral tradition of Kensington.&nbsp;
His racy sayings, his epigrams, his reminiscences, are constantly
recalled and repeated.&nbsp; And his successor has formed a very
vivid conception of that genial and delightful ministry by which
Mr. White attached to himself so warmly the hearts of this
congregation.</p>
<p>But one most significant new departure must be
remembered.&nbsp; Many are the strangers who visit us to-day who
are greatly impressed with the successful blending in our service
of general audible prayer, with the more individual prayer by the
minister.&nbsp; They share with us the feeling, that to encourage
an outward and audible expression of our worship is to cultivate
the worshipful attitude of heart and soul.&nbsp; Nonconformists
have too long thrown the whole burden of the service on <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>the
preacher, and not sufficiently elicited from the congregation the
full expression of their feelings in prayer and praise.&nbsp; The
new warmth that has come to our services at Allen Street, and the
increased heartiness of them, is very largely due to the
introduction of certain simple and comprehensive forms of worship
and prayer, in which we can all unite with heart and soul.&nbsp;
This most admirable system was initiated by Mr. White, who
expressed himself as being quite willing to bear the burden of
any temporary unpopularity of the change.&nbsp; The unpopularity
was certainly never great, and has to-day given way to a very
strong and general satisfaction.</p>
<p>Resolutions are apt to read coldly,&mdash;indeed, they are apt
not to be read at all,&mdash;but when, at a large meeting of the
Church and congregation to say farewell to Mr. White, on the <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>completion
of his eighteen months&rsquo; ministry, the people unanimously
and enthusiastically declared that &ldquo;he had been honoured to
become the channel of blessings which this Church would ever
acknowledge and keep in memory,&rdquo; every word was as hearty
as it was true.&nbsp; On October 17th, 1889, Mr. White presided
at his successor&rsquo;s ordination, and said to the assembled
people: &ldquo;In delivering up this sacred office, I shall
humbly join my prayers with yours for God&rsquo;s best blessing
to rest on my dear successor, and on yourselves, whom he will
love the more the longer he lives among you, and the more
self-denyingly he serves you.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which that
successor may be allowed to write his own emphatic declaration
that it has been true.</p>

<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> retirement of a pastor so universally
beloved as Mr. Symes left the Church in a position of some
perplexity, from which it was to be rescued less by its own
wisdom than by the manifest leading of Providence.&nbsp; For more
than sixty years the congregation had welcomed to its pastorate
ministers already enjoying reputations acquired in other
Churches; and in the eyes of many this practice had acquired the
authority of a traditionary rule.&nbsp; <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>And it
seems almost certain that, if any of the established ministers
whom the Church would have been glad to call would have accepted
what was recognised as an onerous charge, the traditions of
1825&ndash;80 would have been honoured by continued
observance.&nbsp; But it was otherwise ordained.&nbsp; While as
yet no one seems to have remembered how Dr. Leifchild came to
Hornton Street fresh from his tutor, Mr. Charles Silvester Horne,
a student only half through his theological course at Mansfield
College, Oxford, came to Kensington as an ordinary pulpit supply,
and preached with so much acceptance that request was
made,&mdash;but without any ulterior view,&mdash;that he might be
sent again.&nbsp; He had preached only a very few times, however,
when it became evident that he was not only making a strong
impression on the existing congregation, but <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>attracting
new hearers.&nbsp; It was noticed that, while the freshness and
simplicity of his preaching, aided by a genial personality, drew
simple natures, and especially the young, around him, the
confidence of the elders was gained by the unexpected depth and
maturity of his sermons; and then it was that the suppressed
thought of many at length found simultaneous utterance, and the
question was asked whether this was not the kind of minister most
suited to the wants of the Kensington congregation.</p>
<p>Inquiries were made, and then it was ascertained that Mr.
Horne had still eighteen months of his course at Mansfield to
complete, and that of these Dr. Fairbairn would not abate even a
week.&nbsp; By this time, however, the Church had made up its
mind, and unanimously offered to pledge itself to call Mr. Horne
in due form at the end of a year and <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>a half, if he, in his turn, would
engage to come to Kensington at that date, and also visit the
congregation in the meantime as often as he could.&nbsp; This
arrangement was made, together with a further and supplementary
one with the Rev. Edward White, who had just left Kentish Town,
and who kindly undertook the pastoral oversight of the Church
till the autumn of 1889.&nbsp; In this way, as was pleasantly
observed at the time, Kensington at once secured the services of
&ldquo;the youngest old man and the oldest young man in the
Congregational body.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. White more than fulfilled
the expectations of the congregation, and in the brief period of
his service established himself permanently in the affections of
the congregation, while he prepared the way for the coming of his
young successor.</p>
<p>Mr. Horne was ordained at Kensington in <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>October
1889, the venerable Dr. Stoughton, Dr. Fairbairn, and Dr. Dale,
with the Revs. E. White, R. F. Horton, and W. Roberts, taking
part in the services.&nbsp; This is not the time to speak at
large of a pastorate so recently begun, but it is not too soon to
say that the hopes on which the Kensington Church acted five
years ago have been justified by experience.&nbsp; Congregations
were never larger; the young are being gathered and organised in
guilds as well for instruction and work as for social purposes;
the young members of the Church meet regularly for spiritual
edification.&nbsp; The London Missionary Society and other
agencies external to the congregation are supported with the old
constancy and liberality, and the Church itself is as united as
ever in purpose and heart.</p>

<span class="smcap">minister</span> may surely be excused for
writing &ldquo;once more, in conclusion,&rdquo; after the
&ldquo;lastly&rdquo; of Chapter IX.&nbsp; He is, however, quite
prepared to see the reader grow indifferent or uneasy, under the
impression that the epilogue has been dragged in with the
ulterior intention of pointing a moral.&nbsp; The story has been
told; what need can there be to prolong it?&nbsp; But so hardened
has the writer become that he unmercifully proceeds to have his
own way&mdash;a bad habit, into which a too-indulgent
congregation has injudiciously <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>trained him.&nbsp; The perusal of
our simple records is calculated to confirm the faith of us all
in the possibilities of a Church of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Dr.
Stoughton likes to say that the Church here was never asked for
money when it did not meet the request; and, perhaps, that is the
least of all its gifts.&nbsp; Its chronicler lays down the pen
with the thankful conviction that it has ever given a place in
its heart and in its practical sympathy to any really worthy and
beneficent object.&nbsp; Its controversies have been conducted in
honourable Christian fashion, and where its convictions have been
deep its efforts have been unremitting.&nbsp; Perhaps the truest
test of a Church is in the men and women it makes and
influences.&nbsp; Kensington Chapel has been associated with many
eminent and brilliant names.&nbsp; Lawyers such as Mr. Justice
Talfourd, statesmen <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>such as Mr. Henry Richard,
physicians such as Sir Risdon Bennett, authors such as Dr. Samuel
Smiles and Robert Alfred Vaughan, as well as Royal Academicians
and influential writers for the public press, have united here in
common worship.&nbsp; And lest we should be overwhelmed, and
unduly sobered, by so great a weight of dignity, was there not
once an editor of <i>Punch</i> as a member of the
congregation?&nbsp; Who will say of us that our Puritan manners
are irreconcilable with a love of humour!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diversity of ministrations but the same spirit&rdquo;
seems to have been the law of Apostolical succession in this
Church.&nbsp; The ministers have been very unlike one another;
but there has been a great substance of truth which they have
preached, and an unbroken unity of purpose and aim.&nbsp; Those
who think <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>a Church needs thirty-nine articles to ensure the unity
of the spirit will please make a note of this.</p>
<p>The Church has been distinguished for its readiness of
adjustment to new opportunities and occasions.&nbsp; The
development of modern London has drawn Kensington from its
position of a secluded proximity to the City, into actual organic
union with it.&nbsp; All the problems of London to-day are
ours.&nbsp; We are no longer outside of it.&nbsp; Our life is
Metropolitan.&nbsp; The change has been faced by the Church with
a frank recognition and a cheerful courage.&nbsp; It has
acknowledged practically the claims of poorer London on its
liberality and sympathy; and it is resolutely addressing itself
to discover its own distinctive mission to the poverty and misery
of other neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>It was clearly not for nothing that the idea <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>of the
Church emerged slowly but surely out of the looser conceptions of
association for the purpose of managing the business affairs
connected with a place of worship.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s hand was in
it all, as we can so clearly see to-day; and in process of the
years the great ideal of a Christian Brotherhood&mdash;an ideal
which is not new, but old&mdash;has laid hold of the thought and
imagination of the people.&nbsp; Dr. Edwin Hatch, the most
original ecclesiastical historian of this generation, said in
memorable words, &ldquo;the unaccomplished mission of the
Christian Church is to reconstruct society on the basis of
brotherhood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Towards that reconstruction every
Christian community that tries to realise its brotherhood in
Christ contributes something.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the century whose record we have reviewed,
Missionary Societies were just beginning, Sunday Schools were in
their <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>infancy, and the great catalogue of benevolent and
philanthropic societies that stand on the Church&rsquo;s list was
all unknown.&nbsp; Thus the work of one hundred years makes us
exceedingly hopeful.&nbsp; Our experience is all in our
favour.&nbsp; And after having lived and grown through a century
of time, it is possible for us, as a Church, to approximate to
that ideal where there are blended the ripeness and maturity of
autumn with the freshness and buoyancy of spring.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
